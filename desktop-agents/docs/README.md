## Privacy Considerations

The ActivTrack agent includes features designed to protect user privacy:

- **Notification System**: Visual indicators when screenshots are taken
- **Configurable Monitoring**: Admins can disable certain tracking features
- **Data Retention**: Captured data adheres to configurable retention policies

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Agent Not Connecting**
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Check API key and server URL
   - Ensure firewall allows outbound connections

2. **Screenshots Not Capturing**
   - Verify screenshot permission is granted
   - Check if private mode is enabled
   - Ensure screenshotFrequency setting is not zero

3. **High Resource Usage**
   - Update to the latest agent version
   - Adjust tracking intervals to be less frequent
   - Exclude resource-intensive applications from monitoring
